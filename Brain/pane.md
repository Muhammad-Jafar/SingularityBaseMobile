Since 2024 android state of the art no longer suggest using `Screen` component.
Since some device might display multiple screen in the future (like foldable device for example), and is suggested to use `Pane` (sort for Panel).

Ex: instead of calling it `DashboardScreen`, today we suggest to name it `DashboardPane`.
